    <h2><i>The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being 
        "the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage". 
        It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history.
         The Taj Mahal attracts 7–8 million visitors a year and in 2007, 
        it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World (2000–2007) initiative.
        Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years. 
        The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 32 million rupees,
         which in 2020 would be approximately 70 billion rupees (about U.S. $956 million). 
        The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by the court architect to the emperor, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri.

            was built as the headquarters of the Great Indian Peninsular Railway.
            The railway station was built to replace the Bori Bunder railway station, 
            in the Bori Bunder area of Bombay, a prominent port and warehouse area known for its imports and exports. Since Bombay became a major port city at the time, 
            a bigger station was built to meet its demands, and was named Victoria Terminus, after the then reigning Empress of India, Queen Victoria.
            The station was designed by Frederick William Stevens, 
            a British born engineer architect, 
            attached to the Bombay office of the Indian colonial Public Works Department.
            The interior of the building was conceived as a series of large rooms with high ceilings. 
            It is a utilitarian building and has had various changes required by the users, not always sympathetic. 
            It has a C-shaped plan which is symmetrical  </i></h2>

                  the first British monarch to visit India. At the time of the royal visit, the gateway was not yet built,
                  and a cardboard structure greeted the monarch.
                  The foundation stone was laid in March 1913 for a monument built in the Indo-Saracenic style, 
                  incorporating elements of 16th-century Gujarati architecture. The final design of the monument by architect George Wittet was sanctioned only in 1914, 
                  and construction was completed in 1924. The structure is a triumphal arch made of basalt, 
                  which is 26 metres (85 feet) high.It is an effort from the architect George Wittet.</h2> </i></p>
