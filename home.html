        <br><p><h2>What can I say about my nation – ‘India?’ Being a land of diversity, my nation, India, has been witnessing a large number of tourists from every corner of the planet. Its capital city “New Delhi” is one of the oldest cities in the world whose rich historical and cultural heritage cannot be expressed in mere words.

            Taking immense pride in more than 29 States and 7 Union Territories, I am proud to have been born and raised in such a magnificent country. India is a country with unity in diversity as it boasts about its heritage, cultures, traditions and customs that we Indians are aware of.
            
            
             
            There are myriad reasons supporting the fact that India is an emerging superpower. Other than becoming the most populated nation in the world by 2025, I am sure that India will have gained the ‘superpower’ status by then. In fact, my nation has the 3rd largest armed forces in the world
            The early period of Modern India witnessed the growth of Company Rule in India. The Company Rule in the Indian sub-continent is also referred to as Company Raj. It was the rule of the British East India Company that extended to many parts of India. It is believed to have begun in the year 1757 after the end of Battle of Plassey.
            There are three main phases of the Indian history: Pre-historic and Ancient era, the Medieval era, and the Modern era. Prehistoric and Ancient Era (Prehistoric era up to 1187 CE) Fossil records show that India was inhabited as early as the Middle Pleistocene period. The Soan Valley River contains some of the early archeological sites. 
            The term Medieval India is used to refer to the post classical history of India. It is divided into the early medieval period and into the late medieval period. The following are the major events and personalities in Medieval India:
            The rulers that ruled Delhi were either descendants of slaves or the slaves. In other words, it was the slave dynasty. They took advantage the good relationship and experience that they had with the former masters in order to take over leadership. Eventually, they moved from slavery to leadership.</h2></p>
