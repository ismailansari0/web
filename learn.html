    <p>India is one of the oldest civilizations in the world, 
      spanning a period of more than 4000 years, 
      and witnessing the fusion of several customs and traditions, 
      which are reflective of the rich culture and heritage of the Country.
      The history of the nation gives a glimpse into the magnanimity of its evolution - 
      from a Country reeling under colonialism, to one of the leading economies in the global scenario within a span of fifty years. 
      More than anything, the nationalistic fervour of the people is the contributing force behind the culmination of such a development. 
      This transformation of the nation instills a sense of national pride in the heart of every Indian within the Country and abroad, 
      and this section is a modest attempt at keeping its flame alive.<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
      India is a land of different cultures, heritages, many languages and religions. Despite the differences our India is united in its diversity.
      The people of this country, its beautiful cultures, its languages, 
      the places and the good heart of the Indians make us feel proud that we are born in such a beautiful land. 
      Our mother India has been teaching her children different skills and talents such as sports, archery, defences, music, 
      dance, art, humanity, kindness, love, tenderness and acting. 
      When we have such a beautiful land to live in, then why will not our heart be filled with pride?.
      My country is a land of villages and fields full of bodies. I am proud of his village from which the Indian civilization flourished. 
      Most of the great leaders of our country came from villages.
      Our fields are fed by mighty rivers like Ganges, Yamuna, Brahmaputra, Godavari, Narmada, Krishna and Kavery . 
      The Gangetic Valley is the most fertile region of our country.
     The oceans bathing its shores on three sides and the mighty Himalayas to the north have given my country natural boundaries. 
     Once again, the attraction of the mountain has attracted many adventures to this land of rich culture.
     Our state is secular. On his knees breathe the happy disciples of the different religions of the world. 
     We have a unique culture that has vested throughout the centuries. 
     There is a lot of diversity among our people. We speak several languages,
      we worship many gods and yet we have the same spirit, the spirit of India, which crosses all parts of our country and binds us all together. 
      We have a great unity in diversity.</span></p>
